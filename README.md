This project explores the relationship between student engagement in extracurricular activities and their academic performance. The study gathered data through a structured survey of university students, focusing on aspects such as time management, frequency of participation in extracurricular activities, and self-reported academic performance. The dataset was analyzed using various statistical tools, including bar plots, violin plots, and hypothesis testing to identify trends and potential correlations.

Key findings include gender-based differences in participation, time management strategies, and academic outcomes. Hypothesis testing was performed to assess relationships such as gender-based activity hours and the connection between age and frequency of participation. However, no statistically significant relationships were found in certain areas, highlighting the need for careful interpretation of data.
